This is a fork of the flash viewer, which already has a thin custom driver. It should be pretty easy to modify that driver for headless use.


===============================
Usage:

./screen_grabber romfile output_file_prefix

Example:

./screen_grabber dk_rom_1 test_output/dk_out    # (Assumes test_output/ exists)

===============================
Important files:

snes9x-flash/flash/headless.cpp - The main C file -- essentially our driver, takes a ROM file and outputs a series of screenshots
snes9x-flash/Makefile.headless - The application's Makefile
snes9x-flash/png - contains the png library used for image output


===============================
Building:

make -f Makefile.headless;


===============================
Compressing output:

Currently the generated PNG's are not optimized for compression. To do that, I'd need to generate the palette for every image.

Instead, use pngcrush if compression is necessary. Example usage:

`pngcrush -bit_depth=8 -v test-screenshot2.png test-compressed-screenshot2.png`

To join into a single PNG: (Replace "output_file_prefix")

convert 'output_file_prefix*.png' +append test_spritized.png && pngcrush test_spritized.png
